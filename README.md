p3-style-tile
=============
* I have a reference for my default type styling. I'm experiementing with the feel of different sizes. The original was based off 100% and I believe I changed mine to 120%. That would be the only difference.
* I wanted to style the tile without adding classes or any additional markup. I did however wrap the container in a background because the texture I chose looked like start.... they had to orbit. Also I did add tabindex. Other than that I just added two more paragraphs to test the p styling.
* The logo I chose is redonkulous(THE STATUE OF STICKS!). The reason why I chose it is based on the reason why I want to do VCD. It represents designing with purpose and reasoning. It's a custom grid layout that I use for graphite/ink/whateva designs.
* I was quite unsure as to how to approach this project. I did not know how much of the markup we were allowed to change. If we can go hogwild with this then I will be changing it ALOT. I should have asked.
